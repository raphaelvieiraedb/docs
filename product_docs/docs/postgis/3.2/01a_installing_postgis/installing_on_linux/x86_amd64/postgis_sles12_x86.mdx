Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access
# to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE
# registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE module
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Install the package

```shell
# To install PostGIS 3.2:
zypper install edb-as<xx>-postgis32

# To install PostGIS 3.1 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13-14:
zypper install edb-as<xx>-postgis3

# To install PostGIS 3.1 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11-12:
zypper install edb-as12-postgis
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Replace `<xx>` with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using. For example, `edb-as14-postgis32`.
