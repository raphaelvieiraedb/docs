[EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/) is a lightweight connection pooling utility that you can use to more quickly connect to your BigAnimal cluster. It saves you time by pooling previously established connections to your server. Instead of connecting directly to your server, EDB PgBouncer negotiates your connections for you. 

Perform these steps to configure EDB PgBouncer with your BigAnimal cluster.

## Update the EDB PgBouncer configuration file

To install EDB PgBouncer, see [Installing EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/01_installation/).

Navigate to your BigAnimal cluster connection information: 

1. Open BigAnimal. 

1. Go to **Clusters > Connect**. 

1. Under **Connection Info**, find your cluster connection information. The following table is an example of connection information: 

   | Information field | Value |
   |-------------------|-------|
   | Service URI | postgres://p-zdj5rioiy1.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.enterprisedb.network:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require |
   | Dbname | edb_admin |
   | Host | p-zdj5rioiy1.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.enterprisedb.network |
   | Port | 5432 |
   | User | edb_admin |

Configure EDB PgBouncer according to the connection information:

1. Update the PgBouncer configuration file `/etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini`:

   ```ini
   [databases]
   [database name] = host=<Host>
   port=<Port> 
   user=<User> 
   dbname=<Dbname>
   [pgbouncer]
   # Enter * to listen on all addresses:
   listen_addr=*
   # Enter the port to listen on:
   listen_port=
   # Enter your setting for authenticating users:
   auth_type=
   # Enter the file that contains the list of usernames and passwords:
   auth_file= 
   ```

1. Add your cluster username and password to the `auth_file`, located in /etc/pgbouncer/ by default. For example:

   ```text
      "user1" "password1"
   ```

   The default username is in the **User** field in BigAnimal. The password is the same you set when configuring the cluster.

For more information, see [Configuring EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/02_configuration_and_usage/). 

## Connect to the BigAnimal cluster

For the next steps, you need `psql` or another database client installed. See [Connecting to your cluster](../02_connecting_your_cluster/) for more information. 

1. Connect to the remote EDB PgBouncer service according to your cluster connection information with the command: 

   ```sql
   psql -h <Host> -p <listen_port> -U <User> <database name>
   ```

1. Enter the password for the database user. 

1. EDB PgBouncer attempts to connect to your BigAnimal cluster.
