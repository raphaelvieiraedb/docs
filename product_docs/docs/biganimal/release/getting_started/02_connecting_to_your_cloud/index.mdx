Before connecting to your cloud, 

- You must set permissions to allow BigAnimal to perform maintenance operations in your cloud.

  - **If connecting to AWS**:
    Create a role EDBOperations and set its *policy/trust* and *policy/policy* boundaries to * with EDB's AWS account. This allows EDB's IAM users to assume the EDBOperations role in your AWS account.

  - **If connecting to Azure**:
    Register an application with Azure AD and create a service principal to delegate Identity and Access Management functions to Azure Active Directory (AD).

   BigAnimal CLI commands used in the procedures for connecting your cloud to BigAnimal automatically sets these permissions for you. For more information, see EDB cloud utilites in GitHub for [Azure](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/tree/main/azure) and [AWS](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/tree/main/aws).

 - **If connecting to an AWS account, ensure that:** 

   You are assigned the following AWS managed policies (or an equivalent custom policy granting full access to resources):

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ServiceQuotasFullAccess
    
 - **If connecting to an Azure subscription, ensure that:** 
 
   You are assigned either of the following roles in Azure AD:

    - Global Administrator

    - Privileged Role Administrator

   BigAnimal creates and uses a custom role called `biganimal-poweruser` to provision and manage infrastructure in your Azure cloud account. This role includes permissions for:

    - Alerts management, insights, and operational insights in order to manage logs and telemetry
    - Storage, compute, network, ContainerInstance, in order to host the database instances
    - Capacity in order to adjust the fleet size as needed

 - In [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell), ensure that your environment is running: 

      - bash shell version 4.0 or above. 
      - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) JSON parser.
      - BigAnimal CLI version 1.4 or later. For detailed steps, see [Installing the CLI](../../reference/cli/#installing-the-cli).

 - Ensure that the BigAnimal login user running the CLI is assigned either the owner or the contributor role. 

Perform the following steps:

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or the [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) in your browser. 

1. Log in to BigAnimal as a user with either the owner or the contributor role.
   
   ```shell
   biganimal create-credential --name <UserLogin> --address portal.biganimal.com --port 443
   ```

1. Run the `setup-csp` command to set up your cloud provider. The synatx is:
   
    ```shell
    setup-csp --provider 
          {--account-id | --subscription-id}
          --region
          [--instance-type --cluster-architecture --networking | --skip-preflight]
          [--run]
    ```
 !!! Important
     Do not delete the `ba-passport.json` file created in your working directory. It contains important identity and access management information used by `connect-csp` while connecting to your cloud.
 Here is an example of setting up an AWS account:

    ```shell
   biganimal setup-csp --provider aws --account-id 123456789102  --region us-east-1 --instance-type aws:r5.large --cluster-architecture ha --networking private --run
   ```

 Here is an example if setting up an Azure account:
    ```shell
   biganimal setup-csp --provider azure --subscription-id abc12345-1234-1234-abcd-12345678901 --region eastus --instance-type azure:Standard_E4s_v3 --cluster-architecture ha --networking private --run
   ```
  
   For more information on the command arguments, run the following command:

   ```shell
   biganimal setup-csp --help
   ```        
   
 Alternatively, you can enable the CLI interactive mode to have the CLI guide you through the process:
   ```shell
   biganimal config set interactive_mode on
   biganimal setup-csp
   ```
 !!! Tip
     Your organization might require you to review the scripts that are invoked while setting up your cloud account. To generate the scripts invoked by `setup-csp`, execute the command without the `--run` option. You can now review and manually execute `ba-csp-preflight` and then `ba-csp-setup` from your working directory. 
  
1. The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. See [Configure your Azure subscription](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure#configure-your-azure-subscription) or [Configure your AWS account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/#configure-your-aws-account) to manually configure your cloud, if the following readiness checks are not met for your cloud service provider: 
    * **If connecting to Azure**:
       - Are the necessary Azure resource providers registered for your subscription?
       - Is there a restriction on SKUs for the standard Esv3 family and standard D2_v4 VM size?
       - Is the limit on the number of vCPU and public IP addresses in your region sufficient for your clusters?
    * **If connecting to AWS**:
       - Is the AWS CLI configured to access your AWS account?
       - Is the limit on the number of vCPUs and Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in your region sufficient for your clusters?
	
1. If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal with following command. 
   ```shell
   biganimal connect-csp --provider  <cloud-service-provider> 
   ```
 Once your cloud account is successfully connected to BigAnimal, you, and other users with the correct permissions, can create clusters.
