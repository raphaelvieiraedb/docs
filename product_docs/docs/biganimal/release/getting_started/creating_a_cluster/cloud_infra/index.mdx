The Private Networking option offers a higher level of isolation and security by moving your cluster out of the public Internet. Clusters with Private Networking enabled are by default not accessible from outside of your cluster's resource network. You need to perform additional configuration steps to connect your applications in other parts of your cloud infrastructure to your clusters via private network links.

!!!Note
    EDB strongly discourages provisioning additional resources in the cluster's resource virtual network.

For examples to guide you through the different methods of setting up your cloud infrastructure, see
