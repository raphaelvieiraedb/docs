The Private Networking option offers a higher level of isolation and security by moving your cluster out of the public Internet. Clusters with Private Networking enabled are, by default, not accessible from outside of your cluster's resource network. You must set up additional cloud infrastructure to connect your applications to your clusters via private network links. You can also create database links to your clusters.

!!!Note
    EDB strongly discourages provisioning additional resources in the cluster's resource virtual network.

For examples to guide you through the different methods of setting up your cloud infrastructure, see
